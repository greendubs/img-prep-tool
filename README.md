# Minimum Viable Product
We aim to create an image recognition open source platform for citizen scientists to help them aggregate and classify image based datasets. Currently, we plan to leverage cloud computing resources from Amazon AWS, and Microsoft Azure, but also strive to develop a custom independent platform of our own.

# About us
This project is part of an entrepreneurial not-for-profit capstone project at the Information School, University of Washington. Our overall goal is to develop a prototype and raise enough funds to set up an environment research lab that can train the next generation of information scientists and professionals to develop tools and technologies that can give us a better understanding about climate change and environment.
